This is the FINAL PROJECT from TEAM MineGraft (Class CSC 363 Computer Graphics)
Team Member: Frank Fang, Robin Zhang, Eva Wu

This project is a simple analogy of a well-known computer game MineCraft.
The main character, Steve, is controlled by 4 buttons above the canvas. You can use these left/right/front/back buttons to make him move inside the room.
Also, you can click on the light button to switch the light in the room on/off.

Other Techniques used:
Ambient/Diffuse/Specular light on Steve and the walls
